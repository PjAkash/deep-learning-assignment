PCB Classification

Task: Classification of defected and non-defected PCB boards.

There are 3 datasets.


1. Raw PCB Data (Unbalanced):
Defect: 149
Non Defect: 2520
Total of 2669 samples.


2. Raw PCB Data (Balanced):
Defect: 149
Non Defect: 149
Total of 298 samples.

3. Augmented PCB Data:
Defect: 2520
Non Defect: 2520
Total of 5040 samples.

The model has been trained on "90% Augmented PCB Data"
Model performance is evaluated on all the Data sets.
